# Frascati-Classification-with-BERT
This is the code for a Frascati-Classifier using [SciBERT](https://github.com/allenai/scibert). A project for  ATHENA Research Center

Our task at hand is to classify publications based on the Frascati Classification Schema. 
So given a publication, we want a classifier to decide the Research Area, that this paper belongs, with the research area belonging of course to the Frascati Schema.

For example:

| DOI  | Title | Abstract | Research Area |
| - | - | - | - |
| 10.1007/978-3-319-39577-7_14  | Dynamic Load Balancing Techniques for Distributed Complex Event Processing Systems  | International audience; Applying real-time, cost-effective Complex Event processing (CEP) in the cloud has been an important goal in recent years. Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPS) have been widely adopted by major computing companies such as Facebook and Twitter for performing scalable event processing in streaming data â€¦ | natural sciences/computer and information sciences  |

In the above example, our classifier predicted **natural sciences/computer and information sciences**. Notice that we have also predicted natural sciences and computer and information sciences. This is because the Frascati Classification schema has two levels. The first level consists of 6 high level research areas, listed below:

1. Engineering and Technology
2. Social Sciences
3. Agricultural Sciences
4. Natural Sciences
5. Humanities
6. Medical and Health Sciences

Each Level 1 class consists of some subclasses (Level 2 classes). In total the Level 2 classes are 42. We train our classifier to predict the Level 1 class and also the Level 2 class. However, in Level 2 we train on 36 classes, since the other 6 subclasses are not useful (they consist of subclasses such as: other social sciences, other humanities etc.)

# Data Acquisition
### EuroSciVoc
[European Science Vocabulary (EuroSciVoc)](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/th-dataset/-/resource/dataset/euroscivoc) is the taxonomy of fields of science based on OECD's 2015 Frascati Manual taxonomy. It was extended with fields of science categories extracted from CORDIS content through a semi-automatic process developed with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Based on the aforementioned definition, EuroSciVoc incorporates the Frascati Schema and takes it a step further, by extending it with more classes through NLP. The resulting taxonomy, namely EuroSciVoc, has a tree-like structure, which we can exploit.

The first two levels of EuroSciVoc are the Frascati Schema. In total EuroSciVoc consists of 8 levels. The most important observation here is, that since EuroSciVoc is a tree, each Level 3 class is also a Level 2 class and so on.

**As a result**, getting data for the Level 3 or Level 4 etc classes, means that we also get data for the Level 2 and Level 1 classes.
Ultimately we want as many data we can handle for the classes at Level 1 and Level 2.

### Microsoft Academic Graph
To get data, we utilized [Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-academic-graph/). For more information about the graph and how it is constructed, you can visit the link.

MAG also offers a taxonomy of topics and links each topic to several papers, where each paper is associated with some metadata (title, abstract etc). Our first step to get data from MAG, is to find how many common classes exist between EuroScivoc and MAG. We find common classes by searching with simple string matching and also searching by using Levenshtein distance.

Now, for each Frascati class (the first two levels of EuroSciVoc), we check if it exists in the common classes. If yes, we can simply get data for it. If no, we search in the common classes its children and so on. When we are done creating this mapping, we can simply parse MAG and get the data we need.

### Web of Science
For the classes that we were not able to find any data at all, we searched in [Web of Science (WOS)](https://apps.webofknowledge.com/WOS_GeneralSearch_input.do?product=WOS&search_mode=GeneralSearch&SID=C1jwYV7YvUfejTIvh5R&preferencesSaved=).

# Classifier Architecture
After the acquisition of data, we can train our classifier, whose architecture can be seen below:
